        Welcome to our digital platform designed to foster a collaborative learning environment
        among college students. Our platform is built using cutting-edge technologies to ensure a
        seamless and efficient experience for our users.

          Our platform leverages the power of Next.js for both the frontend and backend, providing a
          fast and dynamic user interface. The integration between the frontend and backend is achieved
          through tRPC (Typed RPC), ensuring type-safe communication and reducing errors in the development process.
          For our database, we use Prisma, a modern database toolkit, to define schemas and interact with the database
          in a type-safe manner.
